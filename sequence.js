//build a function that takes an arbitrary sequence and tries to find the next number in the sequence

//some ideas (will try on this on May 10)

//either decide they are sorted or determine if numbers are in order or not
//decide they are sorted
//find the factors of the biggest number (absolute value)
//compare to factors of the other numbers
//compare to index number/length to see how fast it is growing/declining
//each step is equivalent in some way…
//some pattern with index and factors…

//a and b make c, (a)b and c make d, ((a)b)c) and d make e, etc.
